# FinalProject_StockMarket
This is my final project of my C++ class. It's a windows form application. From the interface, the user has to enter a right PIN number to access to the rest of the application. The purpose of the application is to allow the user to register the sells and purchases he has done for the day. Then all the information are saved in a Log file to maintain the records. 

You can see snapshots of the application into the "Snapshots" folder. 
You can also see all the design part into the Readme.pdf file
